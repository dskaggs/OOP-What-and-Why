OOP: What is it and why should I care?
This is a presentation I gave to the NCDevCon 2011 conference in Raleigh, NC. 

Description from the conference site:
This session will explore the concepts behind building applications based on object-oriented principles, debunk a few misconceptions that come along with the OOP label and compare the process for building an application with OOP principles to building the same application using more procedural methods.
